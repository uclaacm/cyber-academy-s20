# CTF After Dark
It's that time of the quarter again! This iteration of CTF After Dark will be the same as before, but last one week: from May 15, 7 PM PST to May 22, 7 PM PST. Everyone gets to keep their existing scores, but we've scaled the remaining challenges to be worth more. There are also a few more challenges on the easier side. Good luck!

And of course, here's the membership portal code: ctf_all_day_every_day

# Spring Quarter Workshops
Hey everyone, welcome to Cyber's online challenge platform! Although most of us aren't on campus, that doesn't mean the workshops have to stop. This quarter's focus is on binary executables &ndash; the files your source code compiles into. This type of file contains primitive instructions that a computer **actually** follows, so it's important to understand how they work. We've divided the content into four weekly workshops, each described below.

So how will these workshops work? Before anything else, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/j9dgf2q). We'll be recording video sessions every week to teach and work through examples. And as always, there'll be more challenges for you to practice with here!

## Week 2: Basic Assembly
What’s reverse engineering without assembly? This workshop will focus on introducing assembly language: instructions, registers, the stack, and more! We'll teach you how to dump, read, and most importantly understand code at the most basic level.

## Week 3: Dynamic Analysis
Hungry for more advanced reverse engineering? This week covers more advanced techniques for analyzing executables. Specifically, we'll be looking at how to perform dynamic analysis GDB. Pause and run programs anywhere to inspect as much as possible!

## Week 4: Buffer Overflow
Now that you can see what a program does without source code, let’s learn how to attack a program that’s not securely written! This workshop will cover a simple but classic technique: the buffer overflow. This will be the first time we cover an actual attack on binaries, so get hyped.

## Week 5: Return-Oriented Programming
Buffer overflow? That’s so last week. We’re all about return-oriented programming attacks now, so come find out how to hijack a binary and remotely execute your own code! Use this workshop to figure it out before you have to struggle with the CS 33 project ;)
